	<p>After creating the cards on the Optimal Workshop website I performed the card sort my self as well as watch 3 other individuals perform the same card sort.
	I noticed that people would often create initial groups and them move card around as they decided names for the groups.</p>
	<p>After the card sorting was finished, the website I used for card sorting displayed graphs showing common groupings among the participants as well as proposed a sample grouping that was based on the responses. </p>
	<p>Most participants sorted their cards based on the amount of use that each feature would be of use to them. I structured my sort based on two categories: basic and advanced features.</p>
